[Music]
we live in a world our ancestors would barely
recognize around the globe the impact of human Ingenuity is now
everywhere we've pushed back the limits of our planet at speeds depths and
Heights that would have left our forbears
breathless driving all these achievements is human kind's
extraordinary gift for invention through genius and inspiration
we've created exceptional solutions to complex problems from the everyday to
the spectacular some good and some not so
good this series celebrates the Million Ways our great inventions have trans
trans formed our world that's one for man one
for among the Great Inventions to transform our world one circles High
Above the Rest born as a test bed to develop
weapons of mass destruction it showed that they could fire missiles all the
way to the states our lives have come to depend on
them from Global
Communication they've made the world a smaller place to transforming
navigation the GPS system means you can know where you are no matter where you
are on the globe from watching to predicting the weather we've gotten much
better advanced weather warning systems so they're literally saving lives and
international Espionage they were using them to spy on their
Rivals even exploring the vastness of the
Universe from Earth to outer space few things have transformed our lives like
the satellite satellites have literally changed the way we look at our own world
and the universe beyond
[Music]
it 4th of October
1957 on a remote military site in central Kazakhstan Soviet scientists
prepare an R7 intercontinental ballistic missile for
launch the Kremlin are using its secret payload to send a message to the United
States
[Music] as the 280 ton missile reaches an
altitude of 223 km it deploys the classified
cargo 19 seconds later Soviet scientists on the ground detect faint radio signals
from the world's first artificial satellite
Sputnik at 58 cm in diameter and weighing just over 80 kg launching this
small metallic sphere becomes one of humankind's greatest scientific
achievements crucially Sputnik has been designed with four radio antennas so it
can be tracked from the ground and its path intentionally takes it directly
over the United States you could hear through your radios these
beeps they're the iconic beeps of the space age but what they serve to do in
America was to terrify the population here was this Soviet technology
overflying them Out Of Reach they could do nothing about it the world listens in
awe to the radio signals from this Milestone scientific achievement but the
real purpose is to send the United States a military message and the US
High command receive it loud and clear Sputnik was launched in the aftermath of
the second world war and now the US knows that the Soviet Union can launch
payloads into orbit directly over their
airspace 12 years earlier America drops atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki ending the Second World War
War the United States and the USSR emerge as competing post-war
superpowers the world descends into the Cold
War the United States is the first country to build the atomic bomb but it
isn't long before the USSR catches up it kicks off a different course of human
history here because suddenly it changes the balance of power across the world
and there's only two so-called superpowers that have this technology
the United States of America and the Soviet
Union a full-blown arms race emerges between the east and west but the United
States has a major advantage they have a fleet of
sophisticated high altitude bombers to deliver their nuclear
Arsenal and they know the USSR lack the capability to strike back the Soviet
Union need a new kind of Technology something called the intercontinental
ballistic missile a rocket to carry bigger and bigger payloads nuclear
weapons longer and longer distances Soviet military scientists
begin developing the R7
rocket and plan to make sure that America knows that the balance of power
has
shifted
you have to remember this is you know the Cold War people are genuinely afraid
nuclear bombs could mean the end of the world now the thing that keeps them
feeling safe is that the Soviets don't have a way of delivering this bomb until
of course they do Sputnik announced that the Soviet Union had the means to strike
back and now we know that our biggest enemy has the means the missiles to to
do this alarm bells ring in the
Pentagon when they put spotnik up there you know essentially being traveled on
what is kind of a ballistic missile it show that they have the capability of
going that high up and that high up is also about how high up you need to go if
you want to you you can see what I'm talking
about here they could fire missiles that would be able to travel all the way from
the USSR to the states at this point the Americans feel
that they need to to to react and and react strongly when it comes to their
own sort of satellite and missile program because yeah they they both have
the bomb but now their you know their Arch eny has a very clear means of
delivering it and and they've told them in no uncertain terms by launching
Sputnik the USA need to catch up the space race has
begun and satellites will be on the front
line keeping satellites in orbit isn't easy it's a real challenge to get things
into orbit to put something in space and make sure it actually stays there so
there are two factors you've got speed and you've got gravity satellites
actually stay in orbit by getting the balance right between the gravitational
pole of the earth and the speed at which the satellite is moving get that speed
wrong and you could send a satellite just shooting out into space get it
right and you could have a satellite that's orbiting the Earth constantly
kind of like if you were to swing a ball on a piece of string around your head
the ball would fly off if the string disappeared but the string is keeping it
in keeping it going in that Circle and that string is analogous to the force of
gravity so in exactly the same way that the the planets orbit around the Sun the
moon orbits around the earth the same laws determine exactly how satellites
orbit our planet the first stage is to find a
reliable way to launch the satellites into
space in an unexpected move they turned to the Navy setting them the challenge
of launching the United States first satellite 6th of December
1957 in front of the world's press the US Navy prepares to launch their
Vanguard
rocket it rises to an altitude of meter then the first stage loses
thrust the decision to ask the Navy to deliver the first satellite was an odd
one the US already had a rocket program led by a man with far more expertise
than the Soviet scientists but his existence was a
closely guarded Secret
the US missile program was led by the top Nazi rocket
scientists they weren't just using the technology that the Nazis had developed
in the V2 rocket they were actually using the very same scientists with Vera
F Brown who had been developing missiles for the Nazis only a decade before now
developing rocket engines for the US they gave him just 60 days to work
out how to turn one of his existing Rockets into an orbit class rocket that
can launch the United first satellite designed with the US Army Von
Brown's four-stage Jupiter SE rocket is ready for
launch on board is Explorer one a satellite the US hope they can place
into orbit on the 31st of January
1958 the US Army fired the 29 ton Rockets
engine at 350 km above the Earth it successfully releases Explorer one the
United States first ever satellite they finally managed to
restore a bit of national pride they showed the USSR that they're capable of
developing a rocket powerful enough to put a satellite into orbit around the
Earth but even though Explorer one was launched by the military it would
transform our scientific understanding of the
planet one of the chief instruments on board was the cosmic ray detector which
had been put there on the advice of physicist James Van Allen when they
started getting the results back from this radiation detector the results were
shocking the levels of radiation were a thousand times higher than anyone had
predicted completely unprecedented levels scientists were astonished just
beyond the atmosphere space is flooded with radiation but then at an altitude
of 1,400 km something unexpected happens suddenly this enormous level of
radiation completely vanished that would have been a a huge
Discovery completely unexpected at that point it was baffling them at the time
physicist James Van Allen had taken the very first reading of radiation captured
by the Earth's magnetic field the magnetosphere this blanket of radiation
covering the Earth will become known as the Van Allen belt without it life
wouldn't exist as well as light the sun is giving
out a constant stream of radiation a stream of charged particles called the
solar wind the Earth's magnetic field takes these charged particles and it
deflects them mainly away from the planet entirely but those few that do
make it to Earth have funneled down into two points or two sort of circles around
the magnetic poles that's where you get the Aurora Borealis and the Aurora
Australis these beautiful green lights you can see in the night sky but as a
result it means that our atmosphere is safe isn't being Stripped Away by the
force of the solar wind with the discovery of the Van Allen belt
scientists realized they need to explore more of the Earth's upper atmosphere in
1960 the United States launch Soul rad
1 it was uh trying to look at solar radiation measuring x-rays high energy
photons uh in the upper atmosphere to really see that dynamic between how the
Sun affects the top parts of our atmosphere s rad one also had another
mission it was the US's first spy satellite since the start of the Cold
War the United States has been flying secret reconnaissance missions over the
USSR but it was dangerous work over 200 Airmen were shot
down the US needed a way to avoid Soviet radar that was identifying the American
Pilots orbiting 800 km above the Earth srad 1 is directed over over Soviet
territory to probe for radar blind spots they'd realized that the radar beams
they use on the ground and they actually go all the way into space so when the
soul red one satellite passes over the USSR it can pick up their radar beams
find out what bandwidth they're on and get that key information Soul rad 1's
secret mission is a success the United States begin designing more
sophisticated spy satellites but it soon becomes clear that satellites have
potential beyond the
military before satellites the distance that radio and television signals could
be broadcast was severely limited radio waves the electromagnetic frequency that
send broadcast signals only travel in a straight line so range is limited by the
curvature of the earth to send signals Over the Horizon you need a chain of
relay antennas and re reers but you can't build an antenna in the middle of
the ocean satellites offer a unique Way Around The Horizon problem scientists
could use them as orbiting relay stations the early experiments are
remarkably low Tech and one of the experiments they
conducted was to launch echo1 which essentially was a giant reflective
balloon echo1 has no electronic components it is simply a giant orbiting
mirror bouncing radio signals Over the Horizon on the 12th of August 1960 the
giant mirror ball is launched into orbit aboard a 54 ton Thor Delta
[Music]
rocket at an altitude of, 1600 km it releases its payload once up in space
they inflated it using a chemical reaction and then they sent some radio
waves which bounced off its reflective spherical surface and sent signals back
down to earth proving that you could send and receive radio signals from
Earth this opened the doors for so much potential in
communication the proof of concept C's Engineers develop electronic satellites
that will allow them to receive and transmit radio signals from
Earth but for these Pioneers just keeping a satellite in orbit is an
enormous challenge the problem the early
satellite designers were having to overcome was the fact that satellites
that are orbiting pretty close to the Earth um they're not traveling through a
perfect vacuum it's almost a vacuum but there are still a few sort of residual
air molecules slowing down the satellite as it as it goes around the earth over
time it's not able to counteract The Continuous force of gravity and So
eventually the satellite crashes back to Earth and burns up if scientists could
push the orbit further away from the upper atmosphere the vacuum of space
should dramatically reduce drag on July 10th
1962 they test the
idea
tstar 1 is placed into a medium earth orbit permanently traveling around the
Earth 2 days later it makes history when it relays across the Atlantic Ocean the
first ever live television images from a satellite I understand that part of
today's press conference is being relayed by the Telestar communication
satellite to viewers across the Atlantic and this is another indication
of the extraordinary World in which we
live tstar one ushers in a new era of global satellite television
communication the opportunities seem
endless but not long after Telstar Falls victim to the Cold
War the US military are looking for ways to Shield America from nuclear
attack they know Soviet missiles would need to pass through the Van Allen
radiation belt if they can supercharge this region
of space the belt might become a defensive Shield frying the electronics
of any incoming missiles they test the theory by
detonating nuclear bombs inside the Earth's magnetic
belts the theory works the Van Allen belt becomes supercharged
and it's thought tstar becomes the first casualty as the radiation surge destroys
its
Electronics tellar was a milestone in Satellite technology space communication
is now a reality but communication satellites
still have to get past a major problem to overcome Earth's gravitation pull
they need to travel at over 21,000 kmph this is much faster than the Earth
turns so receivers on the ground only see the satellite for a short 20-minute
window with communication satellites what you want is ideally a constant line
of sight out to it you don't want it disappearing Over the Horizon all the
time imagine you're trying to broadcast a major world event you've only got a 20
minute window in order to get that message out before the satellite
disappears and everyone's TV goes fuzzy so can you actually have a bigger window
or even a infinite window if the satellite stays above the same spot on
earth at all times that means you have 24-hour coverage from that satellite
it's known as geostationary orbit geostationary orbit is the right
altitude to place a satellite so that um its orbital period the amount of time it
takes to do a complete circle is the same amount of time it takes the Earth
to do uh a rot around its AIS and it just so happens The Sweet Spot is
somewhere around 36,000 km above the surface of the Earth as the Earth
rotates every 24 hours so does the satellite it does a full orbit and that
means it stays above the same spot on Earth all the time NASA start the sycom
program short for synchronous communication to put a satellite into
geostationary orbit although the theory is sound the
execution requires absolute Precision if your calculations are just a little bit
wrong your satellite ends up either shooting off into space or crashing back
to Earth both of which are very bad outcomes and disaster strikes NASA's
first attempt when sincom 1's motor misfires and they lose control of the
satellite but the astonishing benefits of geostationary orbit to Global
Communication are too important in August
1964 NASA launched and hit geostationary orbit they got a satellite called sycom
3 to successfully stay in geostationary orbit above one point in Earth and this
was a landmark moment in in the history of communications
technology the dream of continuous global satellite communication and
cooperation is real the European Space Agency China Japan and India will all
start space programs the number of satellites
explodes communication satellites Earth observatories and international space
stations all begin shaping our views and understanding of the world we live in it
opens up the doors for an unprecedented era satellites made the world a smaller
place you know access to ideas and information and people all of a sudden
became easy became
possible satellites have opened up a new world of scientific exploration Global
Communication and television and they are soon
Transforming Our Lives in unexpected
ways for most of History humankind has been at the mercy of Mother
Nature
before the 1960s predicting the weather was a crude
science for the early meteorologists measuring temperature in the atmosphere
was
key the first pictures of Earth from space were captured from wner Von
Brown's early rocket [Music]
tests as the Rockets reached the edge of space they captured a fleeting glimpse
of the
earth The View was too brief to be useful but meteorologists saw the
possibilities for satellites in permanent
orbit I can't imagine the feeling of what it must have been to be a
meteorologist at them seeing the Earth from space for the first time seeing
these weather patterns from a bird's eye view or a Beyond bird's eye view a God's
eye view weather is caused by the sun
heating our atmosphere if meteorologists could chart
temperature changes it could help predict the
weather but the early satellites could only see the weather not the
temperature how do you measure temperature using a
camera NASA think they have a way they turn to a cuttingedge piece of
technology anything that's got a temperature has um
energy in its individual atoms and molecules they're vibrating around and
as they vibrate around they emit radiation now if you get something hot
enough like you know if you get some red hot molten iron that can be vibrating
hard enough to give off visible light you can actually see but most things
around us in everyday life and in the Earth's atmosphere aren't that hot so
rather than radiating invisible light they're radiating in What's called the
infrared if you can measure the amount of infrared radiation coming off
something you can work out how hot it is in 1969 NASA launched a
meteorological satellite Nimbus 3 to trial the
technology on board is an infrared spectrometer to chge shifts in
temperature within the Earth's atmosphere when they pointed it back
down at the Earth and took those infrared measurements it worked they
were able to determine those temperatures and it allowed them to
start increasing the accuracy of weather predictions weather sat ites use this
principle with hundreds of thousands of soundings every day in the case of
natural disasters this can be hugely important infrared spectrometers are
literally life-saving devices they allow us to predict the severity of storms
long before they make landfall so you can inform people as to whether to
evacuate or Batton down the hatches and in the longer term they allow us to
watch how the global climate is changing and feed that data into models which can
tell us what's going to happen to weather patterns in future and therefore
save livestyle way too weather satellites have made all of our Lives
safer but alongside the benefits of scientific satellites the military
continued to develop them for more Sinister
purposes since the birth of the Space Age the United States and Soviet Union
have both been developing satellites to spy on each
other any insight into their r missile programs could prove
vital and satellites provide an ideal eye in the
sky as early as 1960 the CIA launched their first photographic reconnaissance
satellite codenamed
Corona orbiting at 160 km above the Earth the corona satellite is directed
over Soviet territory with an array of precision
camera lenses the satellite photographs its Journey over the
USSR but working with 1960s technology presents a unique set of
challenges the CIA devised novel solutions they took these photos on film
so these early spy satellites would be sent up there with Miles and Miles of
film and they would just indiscriminately take photos of
different parts of the earth as they as they traveled across it but then how do
you get that film back down to earth in an age before Digital Imaging
the CIA have no choice but to physically retrieve the film from space if they
drop it from the satellite could an Air Force recovery plane catch it out of the
air so think about all the things that have to go right in order for that to
actually happen successfully it has to deploy at the right point in its orbit
so that its trajectory enters the Earth's atmosphere at the right spot
survive the incred incredibly violent re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere the
parachutes would then have to successfully deploy to slow it down
enough the Airborne Rescue Team have to get up and deploy to the right Zone as
well they've got spies on the plane with binoculars looking for
it to then scoop it out of the air there's so many ways for it to go wrong
and even if everything did manage to go to plan it would still be days or even
weeks until those photos would be developed by that point who knows what
might have changed behind the Iron
Curtain it kind of worked between 1960 and
1972 over 100 Corona missions are conducted remarkably more than 800,000
photographs are returned to Earth but by the time the corona
satellite images can be scrutinized they are already weeks out of
date the Soviet Union also recognized the problem
their solution was to replace orbiting cameras with
spies in the initial days of the Space Race the USSR set the
pace in 1961 Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human to orbit the
earth now they aimed to put cosmonauts into orbit for extended
missions they had had plans for space stations for decades and they had an
incredible amount of data on keeping cosmonauts keeping humans alive beyond
the Earth this was something that they knew they could again beat the Americans
at in 1974 they launch a man space station
salute 3 they claim it's an orbiting Earth
Observatory they just wanted to have people up there observing the Earth and
taking photos of of how things change and weather patterns and so on but in
reality it was a spy
satellite the Alma's spies are a major update on America's spy
system they were there to not only direct the the camera as opposed to just
snapping away indiscriminately but also they had the added bonus of being able
to relay what they were seeing in real time without having to wait for the
images to be sent back to
Earth Almas proves far more effective than the cia's unmanned Corona satellite
missions but the Soviets worry that their Cosmonaut spies are vulnerable to
Counterattack the Russians were so paranoid about getting caught out that
they thought it was necessary to arm their Satellites with get this a space
cannon I mean we're talking real James Bond stuff here the 23 mm Cannon
designed for supersonic bombers is adapted to fit the salute space
station but firing a cannon in space presents unique problems Newton's third
law kind of gets in the way this idea that for every Force there is an equal
and opposite reaction you know if you stand and point a gun you'll feel the
recoil But ultimately your feet stuck to the ground will will absorb most of that
force in space you don't have that luxury you know they could have actually
fired on an approaching enemy and shot themselves out of orbit and off into
space the Soviet Union had taken cold war warriors into space now the USA was
about to announce a jaw-dropping
escalation since the dawn of the Cold War the Spectre of nuclear apocalypse
hung over both the east and west but Armageddon is kept at Bay by a
balance of power known as mutually assured
destruction both the USA and the USSR possess an enormous arsenal of nuclear
warheads and the intercontinental ballistic missiles to deliver them but
both Powers know that if one side ever pushed the nuclear button the other
could react in kind firing the first missile would effectively be nuclear
suicide because once retaliatory missiles were Airborne the aggressor
would also be doomed they're able to see these missiles coming towards them but
they can't stop them all they can do is wait Ronald Reagan was not happy about
this at all let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope
what if we could intercept and Destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they
reached our own soil or that of our allies in 1983 President Ronald Reagan
sets America's best and brightest the task of finding a way to render mutually
assured destruction obsolete the program will become known as the Strategic
Defense
Initiative Reagan got together his best and brightest military Minds to try and
come up with ways to shoot down an intercontinental ballistic missile while
it's in space that was going to mean they'd have to arm satellites and the
Weaponry they imagine mounting on board the satellites come straight out of
Science Fiction Reagan was thinking about putting um laser beams on there
high energy kinetic projectiles potentially even nukes I mean this was
this was totally outlandish and in fact the people thought that at the time as
well it's why they nicknamed it Star Wars this is such an incredibly
difficult task first you've got to identify these missiles which are
traveling really fast you've got to be able to Target them effectively uh bear
in mind as well they're going to be a ton of decoys once you've done all of
that then you go and try and shoot them down and you got to be 100% sure that
these incredibly complicated high-tech weapons are going to work first time and
every time while the USA see the Strategic
Defense Initiative as purely defensive the USSR see it very
differently actually it shifts the balance in mutually assured destruction
fundamentally the Americans could launch a first strike and when the Russians try
and retaliate if a significant number of their Warheads get intercepted then that
means that the Americans are going to win a nuclear war this meant that the
Soviets were going to have to produce their own equivalent of Star Wars it
wasn't long before the program ran out of money and eventually the whole
country ran out of money with the Soviet Union collapsing just a few years
later space again becomes the arena for exploration and research and scientists
look to turn satellites outwards to explore the vastness of the universe
since Galileo first turned his telescope towards the night sky in
1610 astronomers have struggled for a clear view of the
heavens the Earth's atmosphere is like a big soup there's a lot of material that
distorts our view of space in fact you can see this with your own naked eye
when you look at a star that's low on the horizon you can see it twinkling
that's the Earth's atmosphere affecting it if we could somehow get a telescope
on a satellite completely outside of the Earth's atmosphere it would be an
absolute
breakthrough NASA propos a program to do just
that in 1983 work begins on the large Space
Telescope placed high above the atmosphere it should give astronomers
their first unimpeded view of distant Stars STS solar systems and
galaxies but to see objects billions of light years away requires the most
advanced telescope ever built NASA begin designing highly
sophisticated sensors to detect both visible and invisible
light all needed to see further into space than ever
[Music] before
but if Engineers are to incorporate these instruments into a single
satellite the large Space Telescope needs to be very large indeed 13 M long
4 M wide and almost 11 tons in weight but NASA's typical satellite deployment
systems won't cut it NASA needs an entirely new craft to get it into orbit
to get a satellite up into space of this size required a vehicle with a huge
space for cargo and that vehicle was the
shuttle in 1972 work begins on NASA's iconic space
shuttle uniquely the shuttle will be able to launch repair and even catch and
return satellites and it's designed to carry
much larger payloads almost 30 tons with each launch exactly what the large
telescope will need to reach space it's a an incredible technological
undertaking consisting of about 2 and 1/2 million moving Parts crucial to the
shuttle success is its heat [Music]
shield not only does it have to survive re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere
traveling at over 7 km a second and generating temperatures of more than
1600° C each shuttle needs to do this many times
[Music] over previous nasar craft used a bla of
heat shields a protective coating of plastic resin that burned away during
re-entry but this type of disposable system won't work for the space shuttle
which is being designed for multiple missions instead they line the underside
with more than 25,000 ceramic composite tiles to line the shuttle with ceramic
tiles was an incredible stroke of Genius because if any of them got damaged they
could be easily
replaced in 1981 the first space shuttle
successfully launches and returns NASA enters a new age of
satellite delivery 4 years later the large Space
Telescope is completed the most sophisticated Optical satellite ever
built it's destined to change the way we look look at the
universe and in honor of acclaimed 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble NASA Christen it
the Hubble Space Telescope Hubble is scheduled to launch
aboard the space shuttle but before it can after 24
successful flights disaster
strikes we have main engine start 4 3 2 one and liftoff liftoff of the 25th
shuttle mission and it is cleared the
tower Roger roll
Challenger Challenger go with throttle up go throttle
up the lives of all seven crew are lost obviously a major
malfunction
it would have had a horrific I think effect on on anyone watching these are
people who know the the people who are going up in the shuttle these are people
that that have worked with them they would have taken it very
personally because a it was their life work B they knew the people involved and
C it was a failure that would have been reverberated throughout the world it was
a very public failure okay are there any for is headed
out that way yes sir DOD lso reports that all allar forces have been
scrambled and they are on their
way it will be 2 years before the shuttle program
resumes in 1990 the Space Shuttle Discovery is ready for
launch eventually the Hubble Space Telescope gets its
turn there would have been a huge amount of trepidation um at the launch right
just kind of that nervous energy CU you remember what happened the Challenger
was only a few years before you know that would have been very fresh in their
minds we are go for main engine start T minus 6 5 4 3 2 1 and liftoff of the
Space Shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope our window on the
universe Mission Control Houston
to give Hubble the clearest view possible the Space Shuttle Discovery has
to launch higher than any shuttle mission before or
since guidance officer confirms a good Ro maneuver four years after the
Challenger disaster it must have been such an incredible relief to finally
launch that Hubble Space
Telescope 3 103
good discover Houston you have a go to open the
doors at 600 km above the Earth Hubble is
released one of the most sophisticated satellites ever
launched and Hubble starts to return the clearest views of the universe ever seen
but for astronomers one of the most incredible moments comes over Christmas
1995 astronomers decide to point the Hubble Space Telescope at what they
think to be a completely empty patch of Sky we're talking like a tiny tiny
little fraction of the whole Sky they come back 10 days later to find
3,000 galaxies I mean just just think about that you know they thought there'd
be nothing there very little it's the best Christmas present
ever for the first time a telescope observes the stars without interference
from the Earth's atmosphere the Hubble Space Telescope
changes our understanding of the universe the images sent back of distant
constellations are staggering and allow astronomers to see over 13 billion light
years into the past because the speed of light is
constant this means that the further away you look the further back in time
you're looking we were able to see the earliest images of the universe were
able to look back and actually understand our cosmological history for
the first time and it blew the lid off of everything that we thought we
understood about the
universe satellites are helping us to understand our place in the universe
even discover distant planets but they're also able to help us navigate
create our own Planet 31 satellites circling over
20,000 km above the Earth constantly transmit their
positions receivers on the ground use this information to pinpoint their
precise location creating what we know as GPS the global positioning
system the GPS system means you can know where you are to an accuracy of
centimeters no matter where you are on the globe the GPS system has also
transformed shipping and and air travel that's made it so much safer because we
can always keep track on where planes are even if they're out in the middle of
the ocean satellites have given us Global
navigation and soon even access to information anywhere on
Earth access to broadband requires a huge physical infrastructure it's near
impossible for users in remote areas to connect to it but it could be possible
to provide uninterrupted internet access to the entire
planet not with landbased networks but satellites Elon musk's SpaceX company is
aiming to do just that but it requires a radical new
approach to the way satellites are used you might think okay well why don't
we use these geostationary satellites that can see large SES of the planet at
a given time we got to remember that geostationary orbit is really far away
and it takes those signals time to travel to the satellite and back again
you don't want that with your Broadband Elon musk's solution is just
to build a gigantic constellation of satellites in low earth orbit that are
going to be swarming around the planet at all
times the project is called starlink a constellation of 12,000 satellites
circling in low earth orbit in order to get thousands of satellites into low
earth orbit you need to be be able to launch every one of those satellites as
cheaply as possible we don't throw away planes we reuse those so why don't we do
exactly the same for space they're using rockets that rather
than just being used once are reusable if you want to get a rocket that you've
launched into space to come all the way back down to the ground then you've got
a very very difficult problem on your hands firstly you need to slow the
rocket down you've got to be able to reignite that booster as you descend
down you're going from a Hypersonic regime to a supersonic and then
transonic and then you want to get it to at least terminal
velocity but that's not enough what you need to be able to do is guide that
rocket into the right spot so it can land on a particular
pad inevitably there were some teething
[Music]
problems
but eventually they perfected the technology SpaceX have been using grid
fins to guide the air flow around the rocket to subtly maneuver it in order to
bring it down and land it vertically on a landing pad it's just
mad the Falcon 9 is the first ever orbital class rocket capable of
reflight in 2019 the first 6 of the proposed 12,000 satellites were
successfully delivered into low earth orbit it's the most ambitious satellite
program ever undertaken once in orbit the
constellation of satellites will allow fast Broadband access to anywhere on the
surface of the
Earth and satellites will soon be a regular feature around other
worlds since
1998 the International Space Station has circled our planet in low earth
orbit crewed by astronauts from many countries it serves as a research lab
allowing experiments to be conducted in
microgravity but now NASA are looking to push the scientific boundaries further a
field with the Gateway satellite AC crude space station that will orbit the
Moon Gateway will allow astronauts to access the lunar surface to conduct
scientific experiments but NASA also hoped to use
the space station as a test bed for new technologies and life support systems
for their ultimate goal sending astronauts to Mars it's the furthest
from home anyone has ever traveled and it will be thanks to satellites it's
amazing to think within 60 years years we've gone from not being able to put
things in space to having the first satellites to now our lives being you
know almost entirely reliant on them they enable us to make more accurate
predictions of the weather and the climate with the GPS global positioning
system we can navigate much much more safely and
effectively and by placing satellites in space astronomers can get the clearest
views of the known universe satellites have literally
changed the way we look at our own world and the way that we look at the
universe beyond [Music]
it there's one invention that revolutionized Global
Travel a breakthrough that can Propel us faster than the speed of
sound it's launched robots to other worlds but Unleashed Untold horror on
our own it's also made our world a smaller
place it has kind of revolutionized the way that we view the world it's taken
this enormous and Impossible Planet and shrunk it to this little tiny thing that
we can cross in just a few
hours it's very name defines the world's most glamorous
people
but are its gas guzzling days numbered or is there a Planet friendly
future for the jet [Music]
engine the jet engine has transformed Our
Lives the most amazing thing about jet engines is that they're a way to take a
mulund ton hunk of metal full of four or 500 people and shove them through the
air at nearly 1,000 kilm an hour they're an insane
invention The Invention propels millions of us to our loved
ones to Exotic parts of the
world it delivers food from distant
climbs but the jet is a surprisingly recent invention revolutionizing
Mankind's Quest To Fly since ancient times humans have
dreamt of traveling the skies high above the world of hassle below don't we all
just look up in the sky and we see birds flying and we think I want to do that
and I think that in an engineer's brain starts the cogs turning where they want
to find a
solution but the runway to the skies has been long and
[Music]
dangerous Our Journey Begins in France in
1783 with Daredevil scientist Jean Francois pilat de
Rosier this fire breathing scientist filled his lungs with hydrogen and blew
it through a flame to demonstrate its explosive
[Music] dangers but it was only when he revealed
the lifting potential of hot air in a silk and paper balloon that pilat de
Rosier made history the first human to reach the sky
watched by 400,000 people we first got Airborne by using
the concept of density hot air is much less dense than cold air it's kind of
like the fact that an air bubble can rise through water because water is much
more dense than air a hot air balloon had air heated up
in the balloon and that hot air that was trapped in the balloon itself gave rise
to a basket which was utilizing this idea that we could leave the ground as a
result of a difference in density this was our first form of
rudimentary flight uh although there wasn't really any directionality to it
you couldn't steer you were just at the mercy of the
Winds inevitably the Daredevil pilat de Rosier came to to a terrible end on his
third trip into the sky his balloon caught fire and he plummeted to his
death flight is a dangerous business hot air balloons remained a
slave to the Four Winds until in 1895 a German inventor named Ferdinand
Fon Zeppelin sent air travel on a new course a guy called Zeppelin found a way
to to create some kind of steering uh by putting hydrogen gas which is even
lighter than hot air it's the lightest element we have uh in a big balloon uh
that also had some steam powered [Music]
propellers sturdy and maneuverable in 1909 the first passenger airline opened
for business in Germany
delog but the Zeppelin's lighter than air secret was hydrogen the very gas
that Patra de Rosier warned us about in
1937 the Hindenberg revealed just how dangerous hydrogen could
be today balloons still run on the density difference between hot and cold
air they're considered far safer but they remain the same problems
of speed and Direction what was needed was a faster
and more maneuverable way to propel us through the air and into an era of cheap
and safe Global Travel and the key to both lay in an invention that was
already transforming travel on the ground the motor
[Music] engine today motor engines power cars of
incredible speed and
sophistication but step back in time and we find a very different
Beast Germany 1885 the gasoline fueled Benz patent
motor car is considered to be the world's first
automobile but the heavy engine is totally unsuited to power of flying
[Music] machine until two brothers find a timely
solution it's 1903 in Dayton Ohio USA Orville and Wilbur Wright have
designed a flying machine powered by a car
engine and so the R Brothers decided to try and build a combustion engine that
would turn you know the explosion the mini explosion of of fuel and air inside
an engine and and turn it into useful motion um and stick that on their plane
as a way of propelling it forward but one issue weighed them
down now of course around this time we already had the internal combustion
engine for cars but the trouble is is that these internal combustion engines
were really really heavy you know they're made out of
steel nevertheless on the the 17th of December
1903 the Wright brothers are confident enough to carry out a test
flight against all the odds their flying machine gets
Airborne the brothers had a trick up their sleeves their engine wasn't made
of
steel aluminium had recently only just recently become a thing that was
produced in enough quantities to actually be useful for maybe Building
engines aluminium is one of the most abundant elements on our
planet but it was not until the late 19th century that it could be separated
from other elements and used in its pure form since then this lightweight but
strong metal has been used for car production
bicycles even our favorite C of drink aluminium was the Wright Brothers
secret the timely answer to their biggest problem
weight an aluminium engine propelled the rght brothers into history and internal
combustion powered flight finally took off the first planes actually use the
same kind of engine that you use in a car or a motorbike an internal
combustion engine where you put the fuel into some Pistons they're going up and
down and and then that linear motion can be converted into rotary motion and used
to turn a propeller and that propeller then pushes the air backwards if the
propeller is forcing the air backwards then the propeller experiences an equal
and opposite Force which pushes the propeller and therefore the plane it's
connected to in the forward
Direction the W Brothers invention is still the basis of all propeller
planes the engine turns the propeller pulling the plane through the air while
the wings use the air flow to lift the plane
up faster and more maneuverable than a balloon the internal combustion engine
powered propellers were the only way to fly until the pressures of a world war
led to an astonishing
[Music] breakthrough 1940s Britain
Spitfires and messers schmits battle for supremacy of the Skies both Britain and
Germany have Engineers searching for an advantage in top secret anel France from
Germany and Frank Whittle from Britain lead the
hunt both men know that the greatest obstacle to faster planes is the power
of the internal combustion engine the engine is turning propellers
and they're essentially relying on lift they work in the same way as a wing to
to to propel the plane forwards there's only so much lift you can get so they
needed a different way to be able to go faster military engineers in both
Britain and Germany thought they could come up with a design which would allow
them to move their planes faster something that was absolutely critical
if you're going to use them for Warfare France and Whittle both find a
way to compress the air and fuel mix without the need for heavy Pistons
cylinder blocks or crankshafts if you imagine a jet engine
as being like a tube and at the front of that tube you've got a turbine which is
turning and sucking in air from the surroundings and then that tube gets
narrower and narrower until you get to the combustion chamber that's the place
where the combustion happens it's where the fuel is mixed with the air and set
on fire that means that fuel massively increases in temperature and so it wants
to expand and that means it's forced out of
the back of the jet at incredibly high
speed and this thrust then pushes the plane forward thanks to Newton's third
law which is for every Force there is an equal and opposite reaction so this
backwards force of the of the thrust going that way pushes the plane forward
really
fast as Allied planes erode German air superiority the pressure is on to turn
the tables but Britain doesn't want to give
up its slight
Advantage the stakes are high and both men find different approaches to the jet
[Music] solution Frank Whittle first had the
idea of a jet engine while a student in the late
1920s and has been working on it ever since understood the fundamentals of
lift and drag the basic principles of Aviation and from that he was able to
deduce that if you wanted to fly further then you needed to fly faster and from
the really the limitations of air density he realized if you want to fly
faster you needed to fly higher and in 1941 he delivers the first
British aircraft to be powered by a jet engine the Gloucester
Whittle Whittle seems to have won won the
race but his design is underwhelming the Whittle jet engine
isn't reliable or powerful enough to propel a military
aircraft in Germany enel France has an advantage he can build on the work of
another jet physicist Hans Von
ohin bronze improves Von Ohan design increasing the flow of air through his
jet engine to create even more thrust and in
1944 Germany starts production of the world's first mass-produced jet powered
airplane the messers Schmid me262 fighter
plane the me262 left Allied Fighters for dust but it arrives too late to save the
war for Germany but fron is jet engine will
transform the world for the
[Music] better in
1949 the first commercial jetliner takes to the air the Davin
[Music] Comet other companies around the world
begin to follow suit and by the early 1960s civilian
jets are flying [Music]
everywhere between 1957 and 1978 Boeing delivered
725 of its first jet airliner the 707 for commercial
use but flying on a jetliner is The Preserve of of the Rich and
Famous and soon the celebrities of the Skies become known by the engine that
carries them around the world what you had in the 60s was you know literally
the Jet Set that's where the term comes from which was sort of a group of people
that had you know the the Charisma and the looks and the money to not just sort
of conquer the skies which was huge but to make the world
smaller the stars who belong Ong to the exclusive Jet Set include the likes of
Frank Sinatra and Bridget
BAU and they Revel in the Jet Set name and the
glamour you'd have to kind of come down the stairs right so it was almost like a
catwalk and you have all those glamorous photos of kind of the wind blowing up
and and people smiling and waving it was a performance it was almost like being
on the red
carpet but soon the Jet Plane is supersized and overnight the door to
Global Travel is opened up to [Music]
everyone the jumbo jet is first flown commercially in
1970 and it's massively increased cabin capacity se's prices drop and passenger
numbers increase all of a sudden air travel goes
from something that's for the very select few to something that's
accessible to everyone and this means that we can take holidays that the
average family can can visit New destinations see different cultures
experience new things and again we kind of see a huge sort of Leap Forward
culturally in our society suddenly the world is our
oyster ordinary folks can holiday and exotic far away
places and the expanded Horizons have a
dramatic impact on life back home and all of a sudden our High Street
changes because what happens then because we can travel and we've tried
this amazing food called a a kebab or a or a curry or or I something else in a
different part of the world we then bring it back and we cook it for our
friends today high volume travel around the world contributes hugely to the
global economy every year airlines fly nearly 4
and2 billion passengers on almost 45 million flights
around the globe but the jet engine has also
transformed the world in more Sinister
ways from the 19 1950s onwards the skies fill with military as well as passenger
planes and one country dominates the United States of
America in late 1945 just months after the end of World
War II a new conflict begins and the United States designs a
jet that can deliver nuclear bombs to farway Targets in Europe and Asia before
returning to the
US dubbed the Cold War by British writer George Orwell in the new world order the
two great Global superpowers the capitalist United States and the
Communist Soviet Union are pitted against each
other this is a deep-seated ideological battle that threatens the world with
total
Annihilation and this was a really frightening time for people you know you
have to remember there's this very quick technological advancement now we we have
the ability to obliterate the world and and people are told this right there
there's you know public announcements on the on on the TV and radio we all know
the atomic bomb is very dangerous explaining how the end will look if it
comes and and you know and constantly feeling like you know this idea of a few
minutes to midnight you know that you're very close to everything being taken
away films are broadcast in the UK and the USA advising people how to survive
the destructive power of a nuclear bomb and drills are organized in schools
to show pupils how to protect themselves what are you supposed to do when you see
the
flesh it means you're in a constant sense of anxiety that you're constantly
looking you know over your shoulder you're constantly worrying about what
you know that next step is going to be and during that period of the Cold War
that's what it always was that at any day in any hour in any minute it could
be the end a true Mammoth of the sky largest and fastest jet bomber in the
world but the very engine that can deliver the bomb becomes the best
Safeguard against it ever being used in 1957 the US Air Force
demonstrates the reach of its new B52 Strat Fortress nuclear bomber by flying
them nonstop around the world the capability of the B-52 acts as
a nuclear deterrent in the increasingly hostile
standoff this time the threat of War seized the jet engine propelled to new
heights during the Cold War the US and the USSR were thinking of ways of
attacking one another they saw the limitations with the
plane planes can be shot down is there some way we can send a warhead uh
without having people with it and the problem is is that these two
countries are quite far apart so if you want that trajectory uh you actually
have to pass out of the atmosphere into space and that means things like the jet
engine can't be used because there is not enough air there for propellant to
to make it work so you need to create a missile that takes the air with it the
V2 rocket a flying laboratory the V2 rocket developed by
the Germans late in World War II proves that once launched ballistic missiles
are almost impossible to
stop as the second world war ends both the Russians and the Americans rush to
exploit the Germans in engineering
superiority the USA captures V2 Creator verer Von Brown and his
team and the Soviet Union also snaps up large numbers of captured German V2
scientists for its own research [Applause]
program both sides invest huge amounts to take the jet engine to the Next
[Music] Level the Russians are the first to
prove that jet power can take us into space in what seems like the blink of an
eye they supersize the German V2
on the 4th of October 1957 the Soviets used the world's first
jet powerered intercontinental ballistic missile to launch
Sputnik a gigantic jet engine Powers Mankind's first satellite far beyond the
Earth's atmosphere Sputnik hurdles its way into
space to make a date with history that the dawn of a new
era but how can a jet engine work in the vacuum of
space the trick is to carry oxygen in liquid
form the ballistic missile it mixes your two fuels so you have liquid oxygen and
and a more conventional propellant they get mixed together and ignited similarly
to in the jet engine right that causes a great expansion which is directed out of
the back uh and that produces the thrust uh at incredible speeds that that
propels the the rocket along and so actually well on its path it's being
propelled up to incredible speeds on this part and then just following the
laws of gravity to reach its
Target the jet engines that launch Sputnik give the rocket a range of 8,800
KM easily able to deliver a nuclear warhead to Targets in the United
States America is gripped by Sputnik [Music]
Mania and it urgently needs to show the Russians it can strike
back their first attempt is a dismal
failure
but scientists work around the clock to ensure a success next time
round okay we'll start now any fuel loading C
CLE and on the 31st of January 1958 American jet engines fire Explorer
one into orbit around the
Earth [Music]
in plain language the United States was in the space business along with the
Russians and Explorer one was the [Music]
beginning the US space exploration program continues a pace
overseen by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration NASA formed later that [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
year but the Russians score another first when on the 12th of April 1961
Cosmonaut Yuri gagaran becomes the first person to orbit
Earth people on Earth could see Gagarin and he could see
[Music] Earth Soviet jet engines are behind a
string of impressive firsts so the US has to work hard to
regain the propaganda
initiative in May 1961 President John F Kennedy makes a
bold public promise I believe that this nation
should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of
Landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth
[Music] but Kennedy also wants to take the heat
out of the rising fear of nuclear war and we have vowed that we shall not
see it governed by a hostile flag of Conquest but by a banner of freedom and
peace we have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass
destruction but with instruments of knowledge and
understanding and so the pressure is on America's Engineers to rise to the
challenge we choose to go to the Moon we choose to go to the moon in this Decay
and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are
hard if you want to get people to the Moon The crucial thing you need is speed
cuz what you need to do is get those humans moving fast enough that they can
escape the enormous force of gravity trying to pull them back down to the
surface of the Earth you need to get up to 40,000 km an
hour which is utterly immense the problem also being to be
able to do that you need a lot of fuel so you're taking a lot of oxygen and a
lot of your other fuel together to mix it but the more fuel you take the more
mass you have that means you have to have even more fuel so it's a really big
technical challenge that took a long time to be able to come up with a
solution a solution is finally here a three-stage rocket with enough thrust to
get humans to the moon the first rocket that was big
enough and powerful enough to manage this was the Saturn 5 still the largest
rocket ever built it was over 100 m High weighed about 3,000 tons and about 90%
of that weight was just Fuel and liquid oxygen to repel that thing into
[Music]
space on the 16th of July 1969 us astronauts Neil Armstrong Edwin
Buzz Aldren and Michael Collins set off on the Apollo 11
[Music] mission
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] five jet engines launch the rocket from
the ground and a further six give it the speed it needs to escape the Earth's
[Music]
gravity on the 20th of July yet another jet engine delivers the astronaut safely
to the
surface allowing Armstrong to become the first man to walk on the
moon he famously describes the moment that's one small step for
man one Leap for [Applause]
man the jet has delivered Beyond its inventor's wildest dreams so in
1969 the jet engine that's up until this point allowed us to kind of explore our
world all of a sudden allows us to leave our world
world so we have those iconic images of being able to look down at our planet
now I think there's nothing more unifying than feeling that you're a
small part of something bigger so to see those first images
would have felt that as a race as a you know as a human race we had not only
conquered the skies but conquered the [Music]
future with the moonwalk the United States
wrestles back the initiative from the Soviets astronauts are hailed as the
ultimate American heroes and the Soviets are left in their
wake Jets have taken humankind into space but are there any limits to the
speeds jet engines can achieve on
Earth
the rocket powered American plane the Bell X1 was the first craft to travel
faster than the speed of sound tracking the sound barrier in level
flight piloted by US Air Force Captain Chuck joerger in October
1947 This research plane is drop launched from the bomb bay of a b29
bomber over the Jai desert in California he entered a rocket plane the
xs1 and was dropped in midair this was an historic
achievement it later achieves an amazing 1,540
kmph at an altitude of almost 22
km joerger names the plane glamorous glennis in honor of his

as the first generation of SuperSonic fighter aircraft enter service in the
mid1 1950s serious work begins on designs for
supersonic passenger
planes in 1962 the French and the British
announced they're going into partnership to build
Concord 100 passengers and all their baggage from London to New York in 3
hours that that's the promise of the Concord The Joint Anglo French
supersonic aircraft the engineers create a
streamlined plane to deal with the massive wind
resistance if you want to fly supersonically then the challenge really
is the aircraft design rather than these straight Wings you need oblique Wings
you need swept wings and that allows you to fly faster
and faster and you've got to have a much finer fuselage to make sure that you can
handle the supersonic speed
but the Americans don't want the Europeans to own the field so they fight
back to preserve their own aviation industry in
1966 Boeing wins a US Government contract to build a supersonic plane
that carries three times more passengers than
Concord but the Boeing 2707 project is shortlived
the plug is pulled due to Rising costs and the lack of a clear
Market it was an ominous warning that goes
[Music] unheated meanwhile Soviet intelligence
is instructed to find out as much as possible about the angl French
[Music] prototypes the USSR miraculously unveils
a rival super sonic plane the tupolev TU
144 the plane looks so much like the Concord that it's dubbed the Concord ski
in the western press Russia's supersonic jet Concord
ski inevitably the head of the Paris office of the Soviet Airline aeroflot is
arrested for acquiring classified information about
Concord nevertheless concordski scores a massive propaganda
coup when in June 1969 it becomes the first civilian plane
to exceed the speed of sound 4 months ahead of the angl French
Concord but you've got to admire the Russians timing getting concordski into
the air just before Concord 4 years later the Soviet dream
is dashed when concordski crashes in France
then suddenly without warning the concordski is in
trouble it's pulled from service after a further
[Music] crash meanwhile the French and the
British have been forging ahead with their supersonic
project the Concord first commercial supersonic transport has its public
debut at toose in southern France and it's a moment of huge
anticipation as Concord prepares for its Maiden
flight there the end of the runway is Concord
001 [Applause]
135 they come up to 20° she's
Airborne she [Applause]
[Music] [Applause]
f
this Sleek aircraft is safely tested at some 70 airports on six
continents in every country it has visited Concord has proved to be an
irresistible magnet to the crowd it makes its Maiden transatlantic
Crossing in
1973 by 1976 it's finally ready to take
passengers Concord has a maximum cruising speed of
2,179 kmph double the speed of sound and it
slashes the journey time to the Big Apple to around 3
hours but as the plane forces its way through the air it creates a
problem as the plane moves faster and faster as it gets closer to the speed of
sound those pressure waves in front of it start to Bunch up and if the plane
actually makes it to the speed of sound or moves Beyond then those pressure
waves are piled right on top of each other creating a really large
disturbance in the atmosphere and that's what you hear as a sonic
boom when you cross the Sand barrier in an aircraft you actually don't notice
anything changing at all but the changes are very significant for anyone who
happens to be nearby when you go through this barrier they'll hear an enormous
deafening Sonic Boom which can even smash Windows of houses on the ground
[Music] this loud thunder-like Sonic Boom leads
to angry protests environmental groups have fought through the courts to have
the flight banned and Concord is indeed banned from flying over the United
States and other countries Concord Executives know that the band in America
is virtually the end of the road it has cost the British and French a staggering
$1.4 billion to design and develop it 10 times more than
planned and iconic though Concord is it seems it's not meant to
[Music] fly a crash in France in the year 2000
which kills all 109 people on board and four on the ground signals the end of
this glamorous but expensive status symbol
both the French and the British finally throw in the towel in
[Music] 2003 when the British Airways Concords
return home for the final time the crowds gather for an emotional
[Applause] farewell despite the demise of
supersonic travel passenger numbers on planes traveling at subsonic speeds have
soared the jet engine has effectively shrunk our
planet but an even more urgent problem threatens its
future global warming and air traffic is a massive contributor of atmospheric
CO2 [Music]
as icebergs
melt and freak weather events wreck people's
homes what are today's Jet experts doing to avert the nightmare of global
warming the race is on to design a new jet engine that doesn't guzzle so much
gas [Music]
down on the ground we have electric cars could electricity power a
plane there are a number of people looking at what we call Urban Air
Mobility or flying taxis which are battery powered driving either fans or
propellers this compact flying Sauer lookalike is being developed as a
5-seater air taxi with which you'll soon be able to
hail with an Uber Style app on your
phone it has 36 electric jet engines so it can take off and land
vertically in cities and travel up to 300 km in an
hour the aim is to provide inter city travel that is less expensive and kinder
to the environment with zero emissions
it can go five times faster than a car and produces less noise than a
motorbike in 2015 this all electric two-engine plane
scored a historic first taking off by its own power and crossing the English
Channel it was almost perfect and uh of course I feel
the job is done now
yeah but we are still some way off using electricity to power a large passenger
jet such as this Airbus 350
xwb this can carry up to 350 people over longer
distances but its engines burn around 7 tons of fuel per
hour if I were to replace that amount of fill with batteries rather than 7 tons
of kerosene I would need 250 tons of batteries so that gives you a scale a
magnitude of the challenge that we Face 250 tons is a lot to carry to fly
for an hour but frequent flyers need not despair Engineers have another way to
make flying Greener and they have cuttingedge tools
to help them including assisted and virtual reality
today the engineers have a plethora of tools which allows them to take a 3D
representation of their engine literally move it around with their hands undo
parts of it look inside it and literally take off component by
component you can walk inside the engine if you like and look at how it how it
relates to the aircraft and make sure there no clashes and it fits
[Music] perfectly so it's a very powerful design
tool to allow you to really understand what happens during the early
stages and drisk it before you start making the expensive
Hardware so the ground is more fertile than ever before for engineers working
on complex systems exploiting revolutionary new
inventions the future for the jet engine is really to get further by being more
efficient and to get there faster the next revolutionary step comes with new
types of engine the synergetic air breathing rocket engine saber is being
developed by reaction engines with support from BAE systems for a new
generation of flying machines it will deliver the fuel
efficiency of a jet engine with the power and highspeed ability of a rocket
and it will Propel both air and spacecraft it's a hydrogen fueled engine
but still requires oxygen when operating within the atmosphere but the beauty
about this particular engine is that the aircraft can fly at 100,000 ft which is
more than twice as high as any civil airliner so the atmosphere is very very
thin and that means there's very little oxygen so what we do is we use a a novel
system called a precooler which rapidly cools down that
really high temperature a which is hitting the
aircraft and the reason why we do that is because we need the air to be cold
because if it's cold it's compressed and that means there's a lot of oxygen now
and we can use that to combine with the hydrogen fuel on board in order to
produce quite a potent jet out of the back of the aircraft and that drives us
to very high
speeds conventional jet engines can only Power aircraft up to three times the
speed of sound Mach
3 but this pre-cooled High oxygen design can operate at Mach 5 2 and 1 half times
as fast as Concord the saber engine would make it
possible to fly from London to Australia in 4 and 1/2
hours and space travel would be revolutionized by a reusable space craft
using the engine means we can go any time into space rather than having to
build a rocket each time having to perhaps recover the components of a
rocket to service them rebuild them and put them into
space so we're looking forwards to a situation where we can go into space at
perhaps less than a day's notice as opposed to many months or even
years we've traveled a long way from Patra de rosier's hot air balloon and
the wri Brother's first propeller [Music]
airplane having a spacecraft ready to go at short
notice would make the Apollo program that got a man on the moon look
distinctly old
hat adventurous tourists would be able to hop on board to be whisked away to
other planets a voyage into space that we
never would have thought possible the jet engine has
revolutionized the way that we view the world it's taken this once enormous
planet and turned it into this little thing that we can cross in just a few
hours part of being human is wondering what's up in the sky so the ability to
conquer the skies the ability to conquer where we think Divinity lies is I think
the ultimate expression of human [Music]
Ingenuity how did we get from this to

stimulating our imaginations and creativity ever since but which came
first the computer or the game Believe It or Not Without gaming computers would
not be what they are today right from the very beginning of the development of
computers games were really at the heart of what was driving the technology
forward science and video games have always shared a symbiotic relationship
there's so much good that video games can do for
[Music]
us the origins of this incredible partnership go back to a time when evil
was on the brink of
Triumph the second world war Britain is immortal
danger 500 German bombers and mess Schmid Fighters roared over the English
[Music] Coast German bombers broke through
London's defenses and reached the center of the
[Music]
city Germany is in the ascendency it has conquered most of Europe and its
dominance seems to be rooted in its groundbreaking
technology in the second world war one of the biggest assets was cryptography
the ability to send messages the other side couldn't read and the Germans
gained a huge Advantage with the invention of the Enigma machine Enigma
portable coding machines that automatically convert vital messages
into unintelligible strings of letters they protect the Nazis most
important Secrets especially the missions of their most potent weapon the
ubot they might send the coordinates of a submarine which should have moved a
couple of hours later and that means the British intelligence needed to work out
a very fast way to crack these codes and find out what messages were being sent
to escape Nazi bombers the nation's secret code breaking Center has been
relocated to Bletchley Park a country house where a brilliant young
mathematician Alan Turing reports on the very first day Britain entered the war
one of the hardest things about cracking the Enigma code is the sheer number of
combinations that the machine could be set to there were these dials on the
machine and depending on how you set them up it would completely change the
encryption and because that was changed by the Germans on a regular basis it
meant that you had to be able to crack that code very quickly that meant that
it was far too slow to try and crack these codes by hand and so British
intelligence decided to use computers and these aren't the computers
that we have today tiny little silicon microchips they were huge clunking
woring electromechanical machines but nonetheless they were much much quicker
than humans at trying every possible combination of codes and working out how
that Enigma machine was set up the computer touring designed was a game
changer cracking Nazi codes it helped to swing the war in Britain's favor but in
1942 the German Navy improved their Enigma machines now it could take up to
100 times as long to decrypt each day's ubo messages Bletchley Park's computers
were overwhelmed it took nearly a year to
design faster codebreaking computers regain the advantage and pave the way
for an Allied Victory it was not only for the people of Britain but for the
people of the world Hitler had lost the battle but with the Nazis defeated new
enemies emerge with new codes to crack just a few years later the Cold War
Began these are today's Soviet weapons longdistance supersonic missile
carriers even more powerful computers were needed to crack Soviet
codes but how do you know if your computers were getting
smarter Alan Turing had a crazy idea what if you could challenge your
computer to a battle of wits chering was of the first people to suggest that one
way to do this is to get it to play games cuz if a computer could understand
the rules of the game and then learn to play it perhaps even better than a human
that could be a first step towards making a machine that was
intelligent there was just one problem it was so Advanced this piece of
software that he uh envisaged that no computer could run it although chering
talked about this quite a lot he never actually programmed a computer game he
had a chess simulation game um but it was never actually enacted on a computer
and so the first game of his program called churo champ was actually played
with him taking the role of computer he would manually go through try and work
out these hundreds of potential moves it would take him 30 minutes per turn and
then he'd move the piece as the computer would have moved it but when touring's
chess program played a human the program lost so it turned out that even Ching's
computer program wasn't smart enough to outwit a smart human touring's dream
would have to wait his brilliant idea of a game playing computer was beyond the
technology of the time he never lived to see his program
running on a computer that would take an electronic
Revolution 1950s America there's a growing demand to
store and process information electronic computers are getting more powerful and
easier to use then in 1961 Boston's Massachusetts Institute of Technology
gets its hands on the very latest model the
pdp1 it comes with 9 kilobytes of memory a keyboard to type in commands and
crucially a monitor which could display images MIT students immediately grasp
its potential not to transform business or manufacturing but to transform gaming
the first ever computer game is called space war and it was developed by a team
of guys at MIT Who Loved Sci-Fi movies and so they developed this game where
spaceships would move around on the screen and they would fight each other
and you're kind of rotating around a gravitational uh Center and you've got
to try and shoot the other ship um whilst not kind of getting sucked into
the the black hole in the middle of the uh middle of the screen people were
completely ananymous with it they loved it and the game soon spread to other
universities one of the big things about space war is that this was a sharable
computer game computer computers in those days didn't have cd drives or USB
or even floppy disc they had paper tape and that meant that by giving this punch
tape to somebody else they would have a copy of the program that would allow
them to run the game on their own computer there's just one problem and
that's there's only a handful of these computers in the entire world and they
cost $120,000 that's about a million dollar
in today's money this wasn't just something that you'd have in your uh
garden shed the pdp1 transformed Computing it was used to create the
first first word processor and some of the earliest electronic music but
commercially it flopped only around 50 were ever made computer games seemed
destined to remain an obscure hobby for a handful of college nerds but they
would inspire a young man from Utah and history would be
[Music] Rewritten
the USA in the 1960s Americans have more money and more
leisure time than ever before introducing the American way of life on
the threshold of the golden 60s Comfort
Recreation fun these are the ultimate desires of today tomorrow and the years
ahead of us it's a boom time for drive-in movie theaters and bowling
alleys and the new phenomenon teenagers are demanding to be
entertained pinball machines are hugely popular but one student in Utah believed
he could do much much better the thing that's interesting about Nan busho is
the way that he recognized the potential to do something with computer games that
nobody else had while studying electrical engineering at the University
of Utah Nolan Bushnell came across space War it was a life-changing moment he was
s blown away by this game and wanted to try and clone it and see if it was
possible to to get it out there so that more people could enjoy it during a
summer job at an amusement park near Salt Lake City he realized how he could
bring his game to the masses these were arcades with like pinball machines and
all the things like that but he saw how people were really interested in getting
engaged with playing those machines and thought could you take the computer game
that I've managed to play at University and put that into an arcade but would
people be interested in a slot controlled computer
game pshow was sure that they would if the game's machine could be made cheaply
enough a recent University graduate Bushnell decided to build his own
dedicated gaming computer from borrowed parts from his new employer who didn't
seem to mind really this first idea of trying to get a computer game down to a
point where it was small enough and it was cheap enough that you could monetize
it you could stick it in a bar or in an airport or in a hotel somewhere people
could put money into it and play a game for a bit and you could make money off
that the game Nolan Bushnell came up with was computer space at less than
$1,000 it was affordable and its design certainly made a big impression it's
like this weirdy elongated um bright thumb with a a computer screen where
your nails should be and this like really weird sort of Buck Rogers style
control panel in front of it so I don't know must have looked like something
completely crazy when he saw it but his design for the world's first coin
operated video game was less than ideal nobody was quite sure when they
approached the cabinet what they were meant to do with
it it was a little nerdy for the average user seeing as its manual was multiple
pages long and basically required a computer science degree to even start to
understand $500 computer space machines were built but they didn't all sell
Nolan Bushnell's game in Revolution seemed to have
stalled despite the lack of success of computer space uh he wasn't deterred and
in fact he went away and started his own computer game company and the first game
that they really tried to have a go at was much much simpler very very simple
tennis game that he set his Engineers the task of
developing bushnel was determined to learn from his earlier mistake
simplicity was the key instead of using a multi-page manual he created one line
of instructions avoid missing ball for high score beautifully simple to the
point to be honest you didn't even need those it was obvious don't let the ball
go away just keep on hitting it backwards and
forwards there is really nothing to it it's just a single a single dial and you
go up or down and that's it there there's no fat on that at all the simple
game game got a simple name and it wasn't long before bushnel got an
unmistakable sign that pong was going to be a big hit they would stick them in
bars in the local area um near the developers and there was one in
particular where the developers got called up pretty quickly after they they
put it in um and the bar owners said that you know this thing's broken and
people can't do anything with it which is just not working he discovered the
problem with it was that actually it had broken down because it had two to many
quarters in it it was so popular that everyone had jamed the machine
desperately putting money into play it I think that was probably the first point
that they went to hang on I think we're on to something here bar owners loved
pong for one simple reason it made money at least four times as much revenue as a
pinball machine it was a massive success pong turned Nolan Bushnell's fledgling
company into a household name Atari and with 19,000 sales pong also
kickstarted a whole new kind of business arcade computer
games unlike their pinball Rivals as tastes changed so could the games an
arcade game like pinball as lovely as it is it's very determined by the actual
physical Machinery of of the of the unit right and that's hard to change whereas
a computer game is software all you need to do is upload that software and maybe
just change the the artwork on it and then bam you have a new
game and this flexibility would prove a lifesaver for gaming
companies in 1981 the Japanese company Nintendo took a big risk trying to break
into the US computer games Market they' got this game radar scope
which had done very well in Japan it was secondary to I think Pac-Man at that
time um but they were setting up in the US and had taken a very big gamble I
think it was something like 3,000 units they'd shipped all the way to America
once it was over there they realized it wasn't doing quite as well as they'd HED
they weren't able to sell it normally Nintendo would have gone bankrupt but
the software Revolution was about to prove its worth by that point the
hardware was effectively generic so you had got a monitor and you'd got a
cabinet and a joystick and some buttons so instead they just repurposed them
stuck new stickers on them and uploaded a new game and shipped that out and that
game we all know and love it's called Donkey Kong and was a huge success
150,000 Donkey Kong arcade games were sold making Nintendo 1 and 3/4 billion
dollar Donkey Kong was revolutionary for other reasons too this was a computer
game with a story to tell a little Carpenter watches in horror as his
girlfriend is kidnapped by a gorilla the player must help the carpenter rescue
her was interested in the idea of narrative actually it doesn't just have
to be about shoot things in high score we can tell a story and and the name of
the carpenter Mario but you probably know him better as a plumber he's since
appeared in over 200 computer games computer games had gone from cottage
industry to big business in just a few years by 1982 the arcade game industry
was earning $27 billion it was the Golden Age of arcade
games and everyone had their favorites my favorite was the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Tur uh arcade game it's a really hard game
you you're going around you're just getting beaten up by everybody Mortal
Kombat was a big one I had my first kiss behind a Mortal Kombat Arc cabinet so
even though the graphics didn't look so good at the time I very happy memories
of those sorts of games happy players spent money and arcade owners fell back
on old tricks from the gambling industry to keep the quarters
flowing in many ways these arcades employed the same techniques that
casinos do in terms of making sure you stay there as long as possible now what
do we do when we want someone to kind of lose track of time well we avoid having
things like clocks around uh we make sure that there's no natural
sunlight um we make sure that there's a lot of stimulus in terms of sound and
color because obviously the longer you play the more kind of coins you put in
that slot but despite the trickery after just
a few years the arcades started losing their appeal
the fundamental problem was lack of choice we couldn't just have everything
we had whatever was at the place that was nearest when we'd got 10 PS in our
pocket where it was what the one was that was in your local chip shop by the
mid 80s arcade game Revenue had fallen by 2/3 from its peak in 1982 the Golden
Age was
[Music] over arcades faced a new challenge a
revolution in home entertainment the computer games
console the first games console was called the Magnavox Odyssey what a
delightfully archaic name that is and it was revolutionary because for the first
time it took games out of the arcade and into the home but the thing is it was it
was still rather clunky It could only generate only had enough power to
generate say you know one or two pixels either side of the screen and then maybe
a blob in the middle to represent um a ball so in order to make it any kind of
entertaining game it came with plastic overlays which would stick onto the
screen to turn this into some kind of Adventure if you wanted to play hockey
then you put a transparent plastic overlay on the screen that made it look
like a hockey pitch if you wanted to play football you just swap it out for
that it didn't have sound or color and it couldn't be updated the odyssey's
electronics were too primitive to run software instead of just loading and
saving new data onto the machine you were basically inserting a whole new
circuit board almost an entire new computer specially designed to play a
particular game and yet for 3 years the Magnavox Odyssey was unchallenged the
only home video game system in existence more than 300,000 were sold it was a
tantalizing glimpse of the future and really it set up a whole
genre of devices it plugged into your TV you could play different games on it
this was a precursor of every games console that's come since the idea that
you could actually interact with your television was mindblowing like Alan
turing's chess program the Magnavox Odyssey was a brilliant idea but too
clever for the technology of its time the 1970s was the decade when the
electronic Revolution really took off computers were now processing data
through tens of thousands of electrical circuits using
transistors a breakthrough in miniaturizing them meant you could pack
lots of transistors onto tiny slivers of silicon the result result was the
microprocessor a computer on a single chip this is a general purpose Computing
unit it can do addition subtraction mathematics and it's programmable so you
can tell it what you want to do microprocessors allowed companies
like Atari to create arcade games small enough to fit into the
home so a few years later uh a new device comes on the market um the Atari
2600 built by our old friend Nolan Bushell and this was a truly
revolutionary device now you could just go out and buy a game uh which came on
this sort of cartridge that you plugged in and off you went Atari uniquely were
very well placed at that point to be the people that did that because the name
Atari was synonymous with arcades and gaming yet despite its advanced
technology the 2600 didn't sell well atari's chief executive believed the
problem wasn't a tech the company's game simply weren't good enough he was aware
that popular arcade games like Space Invaders and so on were a huge hit with
the public already so he figured he could buy the license for those kind of
games and put them on his console the availability of this on the Atari
platform propelled its sales to new heights I think this the first time that
you had a third party game sold on somebody else's platform that was huge
Space Invaders helped Atari sell 30 million consoles over the next 15 years
it was a gold mine so other electronics companies
tried to muscle in with their own games consoles so soon we started seeing more
and more consoles appearing every year and this was thanks to the fact that
sort of computing technology was exploding and each company insisted that
their technology was better than anyone else's you've got Nintendo saying
they've got mode seven Graphics where they can rotate and scale 2D things to
look like 3D fundamentally it is about it's it's
about it's about realism it's about color it's about speed it's about
excitement it's about giving you the most overwhelming experience that
technology can offer you at that point this was the era of Sony's Playstation 2
the most popular console of all time it sold more than 150 million units
entertainment was being transformed I was definitely a games console kind of
girl it was the thrill of challenging myself that I think got me hooked
platforming I think was the thing that I was sort of most into at that stage and
you know they were really really fun games even though you know quite simple
I always wanted Nintendos for some reason cuz I always thought they were a
bit better sorry Sega I think Mario is better than Sonic I feel I've reached
that decision after playing both Mario is definitely better than Sonic it
is but in the 1980s a new foe challenges the console makers it wasn't a rival
company it was was a totally different
[Music] machine in 1981 the computer giant IBM
created its personal computer the PC the first machine they specifically designed
for the home not business consoles were no longer the
only game in town you could probably have bought a computer for comparable or
less money that did an awful lot more and was probably more powerful than the
console video games console once you bought it that was it you couldn't
really do anything with it you couldn't upgrade it you couldn't update the
operating system or anything like that IBM electrified the market by revealing
the PC's technical specifications owners could pimp their PCS with powerful
graphics and sound cards made by other manufacturers games designers suddenly
had an exciting new platform for their ideas the people that were into PC
gaming were constantly upgrading their own machines to be able to play the game
so it was not only better for the developers in terms of making a game but
the games could always be more Cutting Edge and it always seemed to be more
games as well for a PC so why wouldn't you be a PC Gamer if every home in the
US has a computer but maybe only 10% of the homes have a games console then it
kind of makes more sense to go for the PC market than the games console Market
there's a lot more potential for getting a lot more
money as games moved into millions more homes designers used the psychological
insights first learned in the arcades to make their products more compelling now
obviously they couldn't control the home environment but what they could control
were the rewards that you were given that made sure that you stayed on our
biochemistry actually um is designed for that the key is dopamine a chemical in
our brains critical to motivation arousal and reward humans are powerfully
drawn to anything that releases dopamine there's that human desire for an instant
return it's that dopamine hit you win the race um or you you explode to
spaceship or you upgrade into a better spaceship or you get more credits it's a
dopamine hit the human desire for dopamine hit that instant return on our
kind of investment in time is something that becomes very addictive game
designers are brilliant because you know they understand the human psyche very
very well from the moment computers entered the home a whole new generation
of gamers were hooked there were games for every taste you could control
colorful characters across perilous platforms I absolutely loved Chucky egg
I just remember as well like when his little legs would go like that it like
like it had some great sound effects you could become God of your own
world control simulated humans Adventure through strange and unsettling worlds I
remember a game called blood Money where you're in a submarine and you going
around shooting alien fish to get money it was really weird you could manage a
Premiership football team fly a fighter jet or drive your very first car outrun
I think was one of the first I can I can really remember spending a lot of time
on you could even Unleash Your Inner Caesar or Napoleon to conquer Virtual
Worlds but real Enthusiast didn't want to just play games they wanted to make
them as well and since PCS could understand programming languages like
basic they could and the first game I can remember playing on it was something
called eom 2 was a bit like Pac-Man I thought was most exciting about it was
that you could design your own map so you could go into a separate program you
could put in walls and you could control where the monsters would appear and
where the powerups were I think we had um games typing book where you type in
entire games um and so that was a lesson in patience it' take way longer to write
the game than than you'd ever play on it but it was really teaching me about how
logic and programming Works which is something I do like all the time now in
in physics so my sort of gaming experience I think H has sort of
influenced my life the ability to create your own games in your own home was
extraordinary and by the 1980s gaming would enter a Brave New World a world
where no nerd had ever ventured
before the new world of mobile gaming all
started with the Game Boy suddenly you had computer gaming in the palm of your
hand it was cheap it was affordable and it had the brand of Nintendo at the time
when Nintendo were undisputably the gods of
gaming it's just this idea that you could you know just pick up a console
and switch it on and it' be ready wherever you were and you could just
play games for 5 minutes that was completely alien at that time but what
was the magic ingredient was the game that Nintendo chose it was the marriage
of this handheld device that was extremely convenient mixed with a game
that was almost addictive Tetris everyone could play
it in 1996 at the ripe old age of seven the Game Boy got a new lease of life
from another game changer Pokémon it became one of the biggest game franchise
of all
time Game Boy wasn't the first or last but few handheld consoles could
challenge the gaming Goliath Nintendo sold nearly 120 million
of them during its extraordinarily long production
life it's hard to describe how awesome it was I mean it was one of those things
that everybody had and I really wanted one and my mom teased me relentlessly
about she's like no you can't I eventually got one for my birthday and I
think I really passed out with excitement after it bowed out both Sony
and Nintendo created other handhelds based on newer technology but the real
success story wasn't a gaming machine at all and it was all down to the genius of
one man Steve Jobs when his pioneering company Apple kickstarted the smartphone
Revolution the huge popularity of the powerful iPhone and the Rival
smartphones that followed meant the handheld console became less relevant in
1989 the year the Game Boy was launched revenue from Mobile gaming was a mere $1
billion 30 years later it had soared to nearly $70 billion half of the total
gaming market and almost all of it earned from
smartphones but beyond thrilling us gaming can now help cure us what we're
starting to see nowadays just over the past two or three years or so
is um scientists starting to really think about how they can use video games
as their their Labs so their own kind of digital online experimental environments
where they can collect data in SE hero Quest researchers collect information
about how people navigate that data becomes a valuable diagnostic tool you
have a Fantastical seiring uh dad who's starting to um lose his mind and he's
lost his journal of all of his amazing Adventures from when he was younger
they've been scattered to the seeds so you as his son have got to go out and
try and collect all these U memories from his journal so you've got to figure
out where all the boys are on this map once you've had time to memorize it uh
then you get into the game now behind all of that is a massive experiment so
what's happening is that a team based at UCL and the University of East Anglia
are collecting data on where you go how you navigate around that environment
what you do when you go in the right Direction and critically what you do
when you go in the wrong direction and all of it is in order to understand what
goes wrong in that that sense in terms of spatial navigation in the case of
things like Alzheimer's disease more than 4 million people from every country
in the world have played SE hero Quest producing over a 100 years worth of data
it's helping scientists understand much more clearly when and how our navigation
ability declines with normal aging but the reason why people anywhere on the
planet can join this huge online experiment is down to the extraordinary
vision of an obscure British
scientist in the 1980s only one group of people had access to computer networks
linked to like-minded Gamers students at the biggest
universities they alone could go beyond the single player experience and play
with others so you could be playing someone
on completely other side of uh of the country to you that you likely have
never met and maybe never ever will meet but you couldn't enjoy the thrill of
space War over these rather slow networks the first online games were
less Visual and more collaborative they were text based games so you kind of say
things like go north and it'll move you North players may have had to write
instructions like take look or attack to play in this shared world but they knew
the concept had a future you had this shared Universe
where you could do whatever you wanted you could fight other people or you
could join communities of like-minded people and just socialize with them that
ability even even that early to share a gaming experience with somebody else not
with you um it's mind-blowing so it's not a massive jump of logic or
imagination to think why can't I do it with somebody on the other side of the
world so when the worldwide web came in that allowed people from anywhere in the
world at any time to participate in these same games in 1990 Tim burner Lee
invented the key components of the worldwide web these include the first
web browser a system for identifying computers anywhere in the world and HTML
a language allowing anyone to create a web page games designers use these web
tools and combine them with the latest Cutting Edge Graphics originally
developed for PC games as a result game playing went Global one of the biggest
was World of Warcraft which launched online in 2004 and is now in its seventh
expansion beautiful ephemeral unattainable I didn't listen No One
listened there was this incredible at the time it felt like an
endless world that you could explore this really vast experience where you
can just bump into other people all the time in a kind of kind of real time
setting where you've got an actual 3D character who can wave and talk then you
can also create Guilds of like-minded people who want to do that particular
thing maybe they want to raid and they want to kind of take down high level
bosses or maybe they just want to faf around and chat to each
other there's such a vast Rich story there that you know like I say I've been
playing it for 10 years and I've still not got through at all online games
create immersive worlds where people can play together and make real lasting
friendships Minecraft was the one for me I mean I spent thousands of hours just
existing in this world with friends I'd only met through a friend on the
internet building a world together it's intoxicating we'd set projects and decid
okay we're going to go to that place and build this thing and we're going to
gather the resources and do it together and there
is there's something different about that you know there's this caricature of
the kid playing alone at home and you know Mom saying you know go out with
your friends and and play there's no go out with your friends and play I can be
playing with my friends at the other side of the world I could be playing
with my best friend who I've never met before on the other side of the world
cuz that's what it that sense of community is a big part of it I don't
really think that we should be thinking about in terms of whether they're better
or worse than real world friendships but they're just they're just different and
they have their own benefits I built a theme park so we
literally had a working roller coaster and there was an artery thing where if
you shot three tugs within a minute you want a little prize that came out of a
machine there's a log flume that that sort of uh the grandness of creating an
entire theme park in a game it may look simple but it's collaboration that's led
to 175 million sales making Minecraft the bestselling game of all time there's
loads of games I really enjoy but there's nothing that's ever got me like
Minecraft yeah that that's a real place that I've been even though it isn't the
problem I think becomes when you feel only comfortable connecting in the
online world and you Retreat from the from you know the real world as it were
that is an issue and I think there needs to be some some kind of honesty about
that but what if you don't have to choose between the online and the real
world what if you can do real things in a virtual world you get to be a part of
an entirely different world you get to have experiences like you couldn't
imagine there's no boundaries anymore there's no things like physics or
there's no you could be flying a dragon or you could be going underwater you
could be going into space and doing a space walk you could literally be doing
anything you imagine with no boundaries and that's what's so exciting with
VR the origins of virtual reality can be traced at least as far back as the 1950s
Air Forces began using ever more realistic flight simulators so their
pilots could learn to fly without putting themselves or their Cutting Edge
aircraft at any risk 21st century technology takes the flight simulator to
ever greater levels of realism but Pilots aren't the only ones now learning
in a virtual world VR for surgery and medical training is
enormously um valuable and it is now being used around the globe so there are
medical schools now particularly in the Far East that use this so the
oldfashioned idea about showing medical students surgery on you know real life
bodies don't need to do that anymore you can have a virtu classroom of as many
people as you want watching a skilled surgeon uh demonstrate all the anatomy
of the human body using a VR replica um showing all the complexities rotating
the Viewpoint up and down um and I would haard to Guess that that's
the way sergy will almost always be taught in the
future but it was the military who had the most resources to create
sophisticated simulations and the biggest need for them in the past
Training American soldiers with live ammunition led to disastrous accidents
one in six of the soldiers who died in Vietnam were not killed by the enemy but
in training so in 2012 after 5 years of development American soldiers began
virtual training what the system is designed to
do is expose soldiers to different types of scenarios or environments that they
might encounter down range whether it be deserts or Mount environments they will
get a gent feel to what they might be able to see down range let's go squad
leader you got everybody back keep moving keep moving go let's get somebody
up on The High Ground they've even developed a program
for Dog Handlers to hone their skills by working with virtual dogs it could help
them find real roadside bombs and with the continued targeting
of Civilian and military
personnel it serves a vital current need as well as allowing professional
soldiers to train in complete safety virtual reality can also help us better
understand the experience of our fellow civilians caught up against their will
in Conflict we helped to produce this interactive immersive piece that puts
you into the shoes of a family in Syria in the middle of the Syrian conflict and
it lets you see how families are living at the moment this many years into the
war and you have this very physical very human connection this emotional
connection to another person but then something terrible
happens the the the room essentially gets raided by some local
[Music]
militia and you have to make a decision of what the family does so you're given
two very Stark choices do you run or do you hide and then you get to choose you
see something happen and again usually it's very Bleak and then at the end of
your chosen narrative you're given a simple message from the Red Cross to
explain that they're one of the few people left there and essentially the
message being that you that these for these families there is no right choice
and doing that in virtual reality it doesn't allow you to escape from that
reality you're in that world everywhere you look it's around you and that's
something very impactful which hits people very heavily emotionally the
power of empathy and the ability to work together in teams are important aspects
of the appeal of computer games but sometimes we just can't resist our
desire to
compete we often think of video games as a very isolating experience it's
somebody doing something on their own but actually
since the 1960s since those early video games arcades machines and even previous
to that games have been multiplayer by Design gaming is more fun with other
people play is a thing that you do with people what whatever form play takes um
and those earliest games like space war and pong you have the thrill of a human
opponent I get to beat you and that and that is more compelling than beating a
computer if I play you a thousand times it will be different a thousand times if
I learn the way a computer behaves I can beat it every time once I know how to
beat it so in the ' 80s um Atari ran a massive Space Invaders tournament Space
Invaders had just been released on atari's pioneering console the 2600
players competed in five Regional events Across America I think 10,000 people
took part in it in the end and there was uh a big uh a big finals event held in
held in New York but even in this pioneering contest the consoles couldn't
be linked together together the players weren't fighting each other only the
Space Invaders it was another decade before
game designers could give players the dubious pleasure of killing each
other welcome to the world of the firsters shooter Doom was one of the
first G games that introduced the death match the freefor
all you have your level your your game arena uh and you're free to roam around
but you you are you know completely on your own and the point is is that
everybody else is an opponent and you need to kill as many people as
possible it was insanely addictive incredibly fun but incredibly
competitive at the same time almost like a sport
but it wasn't the creators of Doom who turned the death match into a global
online phenomenon the original Doom had
multiplayer that was only local right you had to be on the same network and
that was it it was actually the fans themselves that decided to incorporate
it and sort of hack it so that you could play it across the whole internet you
could play against anyone around the world in the late 1990s online gaming
was growing fast but to get the best experience you needed the fastest
connection and at the time South Korea was the most connected country on the
planet they're going through this sort of financial crisis at the time uh and
the government's response was to to pour money into technology infrastructure so
South Korea has some of the best kind of internet networks and infrastructure in
the world so when the online strategy game Starcraft was launched in 1998 it
was a huge hit in South Korea selling 2 million copies there in its first 3
years professional players formed teams and started playing against each other
in ever bigger competitions to ever bigger crowds in ever bigger Arenas you
know the gaming World um very much like the Athletics World Has Its Superstars
has its amazing athletes you can buy merchandise you can buy T-shirts with
the team's names on and you can buy a hot dog for 10 quids and then you can go
and sit down um and for 10 hours a day you can sit and watch hourong gaming
tournaments back to back if you're not in that world it feels like a subculture
but it's a huge subculture we're not talking you know a few hundred people
here we're talking literally millions of people you know we know that there's
people that absolutely have amazing careers doing this um that are poster
boys and girls doing this people are celebrities in their own right if you've
ever seen football covered it's that they know the individual players um and
they know their team and they're there to support them but they're all playing
a video game instead spectators at these Esports events are as enthusiastic as
any other sports fans they're enjoying watching high level gameplay so seeing
people able to do things that you wouldn't be able to do yourself when you
play that game because in the same way that you can appreciate a really good
footballer because you know how art is to kick a ball well you can really
appreciate a squad of a squad of players working together well or individually
doing things that um would be beyond your your
ability and just like conven Sports millions of viewers watch the big events
at home not on TV but online where designers have adapted their games for
spectators you could uh control an in-game uh camera that you could fly
around a game that you played previously so you could get really good action
action shots from different viewpoints that was quite groundbreaking when it
came out in the early 2000s so the big Esports orientated games um that
broadcast live um online have these um systems whereby uh somebody who's
effectively a director and a video cameraman basically can figure out what
the best shots will be live during these Sports matches in the same way that
you'd have those sorts of people recording a live football match or a
live hockey match prize funds in the biggest competitions are now reaching
tens of millions of dollars top players can earn hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year or more do you see people who are you know teenagers who are
getting paid so much money to play computer games I mean if you know back
when I was a teenager I'd love to be able to do that wasn't a thing in 2018
the global Esports Market was worth $900 million with a worldwide audience of 380
million viewers the traditional sporting world is waking up to the huge
opportunities now available in Esports then what we started to see was more
investment from Big multi- conglomerate uh Sports Ventures so people who own big
NFL teams or NBA teams in the US starting to buy into Esports teams as
well even if the games themselves are a bit different to football and Cricket
there's something about putting everybody in everybody in an environment
and making them fight for their lives and and
that's the essence of what makes those sorts of things so exciting is the
stakes it's death
death from their early days as a bold dream Ed up in the mind of one of our
greatest thinkers the invention of computer games has transformed our world
I think there's a lot of good things that have come out of gaming right you
know you have a new sense of community you have you know this push on
technology you have the ability for you know kids and young people to connect
with each other around the world I think what computer games have given us is a
new way of actually telling stories you can be immersed in that story you can be
part of it and your decisions that you make within that game can change how the
story ends what gaming has provided is an
entirely new sort of artistic cultural medium the depth for for human
creativity in terms of computer games is endless it's given rise to you know to
to new sports as it were it's given rise to new ways of connecting communicating
it's given rise to new identities there was a time when children were condemned
for the amount of time they spent in front of their computer screens it's
those early gamers that have come up with apps and all the kinds of digital
technology that we have today games have a huge potential to change the world
looking towards the future and I'm very excited to see what that turns out to
